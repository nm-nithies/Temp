RMSNormalization was introduced in ONNX Opset 23, but the latest ONNX Runtime version (1.21.1) currently supports only up to Opset 22.
Therefore, this pass temporarily uses a locally defined function node to represent the general RMSNormalization pattern.
Once ONNX Runtime adds support for Opset 23, the standard ONNX RMSNormalization operator will be used.
