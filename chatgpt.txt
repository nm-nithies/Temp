ReduceL2 uses np.sum(), whereas RMSNormalization internally uses ReduceMean (np.mean()) for its computation.
To fuse ReduceL2 into RMSNormalization, the output of ReduceL2 must be adjusted by dividing it by the number of elements (i.e., converting the sum into a mean) to align with the internal behavior of RMSNormalization.
