# We register the op `mmcvmodulateddeformedconv2d` with 4-input support:
# inputs = [input, offset, mask, weight]
# This is used when the convolution does not have a bias term.

# For supporting bias, we register a separate op `mmcvmodulateddeformedconv2dwithBias`
# with 5-input support:
# inputs = [input, offset, mask, weight, bias]

# Note: Both ops share the same implementation logic; the only difference is the
# number of inputs (and the name used during registration). This separation allows
# flexibility depending on whether the bias is present in the model.
