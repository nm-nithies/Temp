"""
    Validates if a ScatterND operation with given indices and updates can be replaced
    with a Slice + Concat pattern for a data tensor of shape (N, C, W).

    This replacement is valid only when each update targets the same channel and 
    starting width (usually zero), with exactly one update per batch, and the 
    indices are aligned sequentially with batch indices 
    (i.e., indices are of the form (i, fixed_channel, 0) for each batch i).

    Args:
        indices: numpy array of shape (N, 1, 1, 3) or equivalent (flexible format)
        updates_shape: list(N, 1, W)
        data_shape: list(N, C, W)

    Returns:
        True if valid for replacement, else False
