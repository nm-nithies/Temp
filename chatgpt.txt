Paused the Posenet-Mobilenet legalization task for now 
Started working on Legalize: Fuse sibling operations task

Faced shapeInferenceError in MoveTransposeToEnd pass and rank issues in input tensor for Gemm Op in GemmBiasAddMissingScale pass, fixed it and pushed the code 
 
ConvNext-Tiny-w8a8-Quantized:
Found issues in accessing the constant values of MatMul values in  GemmBiasAddMissingScale pass, fixed it and pushed the code  
 
Person-Foot-Detection-Quantized:
Found the issue in RemovePairedTransposes pass as this issue causes many hanging node issues in the graph.


Found the legalization issue in FuseParallelActivationBranches pass for Person_Foot_Detection_Quantized model. 
Upadate shapedict and comaparedict to resolve the error. Able to optimize the model 
 
Tried to fix bug on VIT and ConvNext-Tiny-w8a8 model
