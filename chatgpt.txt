 Returns the shape that the target tensor should have to broadcast correctly with the reference shape.
    It pads the target shape with 1s (at the beginning) so the two shapes are compatible for element-wise operations.

    Example:
        broadcast_shape_like((1280, 320, 20, 20), (1280,))
        â†’ [1280, 1, 1, 1]
