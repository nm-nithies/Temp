In the constant parser, shape validation requires that the provided value exactly matches the expected shape in length. For example, if the expected shape is [250, 1, 12] and you provide a scalar like 0 for prev_bev, the validation will fail due to a shape mismatch.

However, in some components like usePrev_bev, a scalar input such as 1 is acceptable because the expected shape is just a single value.

To improve usability, we can allow scalar values (like 0) to be automatically broadcasted to the required shape. This way, users can specify:

bash
Copy
Edit
--replace_input_with_constant usePrev_bev 1 prev_bev 0
and the scalar 0 for prev_bev will be broadcasted to match the expected shape [250, 1, 12].
