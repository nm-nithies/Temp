Could you please trace back the outs in the line out_vars, _ = _flatten(outs)? It seems that outs is a dictionary, and one of the values is likely a LiDARInstance3DBoxes object.

To resolve the issue, you might need to modify the output like this before export:

python
Copy
Edit
output['bboxes_3d'] = output['bboxes_3d'].data  
# or  
output['bboxes_3d'] = output['bboxes_3d'].tensor
This should convert it to a supported format and help avoid the ONNX export error.
