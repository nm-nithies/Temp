FuseMultipleMatMulAndAdd pass:
The regression has failed around 6 models due to conflicts between SplitMatMulAdd pass
Disabled this pass for all the failed models. Regression Passed.
 
QDQ legalization pass to resolve Conv's Bias use fp32 values issue:
Added  the pass to convert fp32 conv bias to int32.
Legalization failed due to max_diff after convertion int32 convertion. Currently debugging this


dn_model_c_subgraph1000:
Found the issue is caused in RemoveIdentity_Add pass(broadcast issue) and Fixed it. Pushed the code.

 
FuseMultipleMatMulAndAdd pass:

MR is ready to merge.
 
Stared working on adding support to QDQ legalization pass to resolve Conv's Bias use fp32 values issue.

FuseMultipleMatMulAndAdd pass:
Fixed the legalization issue in dttp_decoder model and re-pushed the code.

PoseNet-MobileNet:
Fixed the qdq layer issues in RemovePairedTransposes pass. Pushed the code



Faced multiple challenges while implementing the fusion pass involving a combined MatMul and Add operation, followed by a Split. Faced issues were dimension mismatches during the split and the presence of hanging nodes in the graph.
Successfully added FuseMultipleMatMulAndAdd pass support
Added unit test and comments, Optimized and pushed the code. Triggered the build
Build failed to dttp_decoder model. This pass need further fix.



Worked on adding a new pass for fusing multiple matmul and add branch into one. Faced issues with output mismatch. Currently working on figuring out the order of appending the constants
