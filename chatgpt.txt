Hi Yvonne,
Some library files return a LiDARInstance3DBoxes object to JIT functions, which causes issues. We need to update the return type by changing the variable to variable.tensor or variable.data before passing it to JIT.

He doesnâ€™t remember the exact file name where this occurs. Could you please share the full error log? That would help us identify the source
