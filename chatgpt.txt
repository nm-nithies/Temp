 trace back the outs in the line out_vars, _ = _flatten(outs)? It looks like outs is a dictionary, and one of its values might be a LiDARInstance3DBoxes object, which isn’t directly supported by ONNX export.

You may want to convert it to a tensor before exporting, like:

python
Copy
Edit
output['bboxes_3d'] = output['bboxes_3d'].tensor  
# or  
output['bboxes_3d'] = output['bboxes_3d'].data
This should help avoid the runtime error. Let me know if you’d like me to take a closer look.
