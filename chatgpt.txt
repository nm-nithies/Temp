You're right — I missed the RandomNormalLike op earlier. Since it generates unseeded random values, the latent_sample output will naturally vary. After checking the tensors before this operation (like the moments), I observed much smaller differences — the max_diff is now within acceptable range.

Regarding stash_type, I did explore this option. The model input and internal calculations already use float32, and stash_type=1 corresponds to float32 as well. So in this case, explicitly setting stash_type doesn’t improve numerical precision — we're already operating in the most suitable data type for accuracy and stability.
