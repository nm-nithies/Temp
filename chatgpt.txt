1.
RemoveRedundantSlice pass:
Fixed all the failed model in the regression 
In one of the regression model( bevformer_tiny_800x450_bev50x50_sim), faced max_diff due to this pass. Found the reason and fixed the max_diff issues. This model contains same pattern but the step attribute in Slice did not support for slice removal. Verfied this with example pytorch code. 
Pushed the code and Triggered the build again.


2.
Added unit test for the RemoveRedundantSlice pass, optimized the pass code, added coments and pushed the code
Found a sligher different pattern from the prevous one in the model.
Added support as well in the RemoveRedundantSlice pass and added additional check conditions
Pushed the code and Triggered the build.
 
Yet to Update the Pass README file for the new update

3.
Fixed the legalization issues in bevformer_tiny_epoch_24_use_prev_bev_false model 
Added Unit Test for RemoveIdentity 
Removed the cast node and graph looks like this
Can we apply onnxsim again at end of the nnac pipeline to remove these constant ?

Add pass to remove redundant slice nodes from bevformer_tiny.
will push the code once after add unit test is added

4.Fixed the legalization issues -  https://gitsnps.internal.synopsys.com/dwc_ev/nnsdk/nnac/-/merge_requests/1039
Addressed all the merge request comments and updated the pass to support operations beyond just Add and Sub.
Retriggerd the build
Started working on Replacing unwanted slice Op in Bevformer.

5.Fixed the legalization issue in FuseMatMulAddSlice pass which caused unit test model failed. Buld succeed.
removed the Mul Node with 0 values. Triggered the build.
Started working on removing unwanted slice node in bevformer.


Add support for replacing inputs with constant tensors during legalization
Legalization of PointPillars fails
