Checks whether all Unsqueeze layers in the list `unsqueeze_layers` 
    are unsqueezing along the same axis as the Concat layer's axis.

  Checks whether all Unsqueeze layers in `unsqueeze_layers` share the same input layer (predecessor).

# Pattern: Redundant Slice after Concat-Reshape of Unsqueeze Layers from the same source
#
#            Input Tensor (e.g., from LayerNormalization)
#                    |
#          _______________________
#         |                       |
#     Unsqueeze              Unsqueeze
#         |                       |
#          \_____________________/
#                    |
#                 Concat
#                    |
#                 Reshape
#                    |
#                 Slice  <== Redundant (extracting a single known index from Concat output)
#                    |
#                 (Used downstream)
#
# If:
#   - All Unsqueeze nodes share the same input
#   - Concat along axis X (e.g., axis=0 or axis=1)
#   - Slice selects a single slice (ends - starts == 1)
#   - The input to the Unsqueeze layers corresponds to the output selected by the Slice
#
# Then:
#   - The Slice can be removed
#   - And its consumer(s) can directly use the original input
