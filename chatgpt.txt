Explored the possibility of fusing the QwenVL_E_compress pattern into rms_normalization.
Added custom ops for RmsNormalization and RotaryEmbedding.
Fixed issues in the FusePrimitivesIntoRmsnorm pass and validated it.

Due to the large model size, the process was frequently killed (disk quota exceeded). So, tested the pattern on a smaller normalization subgraph instead.

Encountered max_diff issues and some bugs in the clean_redundant_nodes_and_initializers function, which sometimes results in the entire model being erased.
