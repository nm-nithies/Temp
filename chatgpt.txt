ðŸ”¢ How Bias Scale Is Calculated
To convert the float32 bias to int32, the scale of the bias is derived from the input and weight scales as follows:

ini
Copy
Edit
bias_scale = input_scale * weight_scale
Where:

input_scale is the scale from the input Dequantize node.

weight_scale is the scale from the weight Dequantize node.

The float32 bias is quantized using this bias_scale:

ini
Copy
Edit
int32_bias = np.round(fp32_conv_bias / bias_scale).astype(np.int32)
This quantized int32_bias is then passed through a Dequantize node before reaching the Conv node, enabling compatibility with the QDQ flow.
