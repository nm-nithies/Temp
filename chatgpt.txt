 # Standard right-to-left broadcasting
 # FIXME: This assumes left-to-right matching for single-dim Mul constants,
        # which can be ambiguous when multiple dimensions have the same value (e.g., 64).
        # Needs a more reliable way to determine which dimension the Mul constant targets

  # For example, if Conv shape is (64, 64, 3, 3) and Mul shape is (64,),
