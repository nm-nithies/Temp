Usually we use logger.error and sys.exit(-1) to make the logging written in files.

logger.error("[ERROR] Compare validation failed!\nYou may consider to enlarge the `legalize_error` setup "
                         "and rerun the legalization if you are sure the max_diff beyond threshold is only caused by "
                         "accumulated system computing deviation and could be ignored for this specific model!")
            sys.exit(-1)
